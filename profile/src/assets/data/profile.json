		"description": "Hey there! I am <strong>Manan Shah</strong>. I discovered my passion for programming when I was a sophomore in High School; It was then when it became clear what I wanted to do for a living. I pursued my career at Maharaja SayajiRao University in Baroda where I learned JAVA and other web technologies and I fell in love with coding and designing. I am a tech-savvy person and like to keep myself updated with new softwares and technologies. I follow stackoverflow, Github, javaworld, javaranch and lot other technical websites. When I am not coding, I play guitar and keyboard ;)",
